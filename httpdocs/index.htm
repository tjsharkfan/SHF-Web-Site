                            Love of Apricots and Memories of the Santa Clara Valley
                            <br>
                            Author Lisa Newman will take you on a journey covering apricots and memories of growing up in the Santa Clara 
                            Valley on June 28 at 7:00PM on Zoom.  Both the Saratoga Historical Foundation and the Cupertino History Museum will be 
                            sponsoring the free presentation. In the 1960s, orchards still covered much of the hilly fringe of the Santa Clara 
                            Valley. Newman grew up in Saratoga and began to cultivate relationships with the remaining orchardists and to learn 
                            about the area.  She transferred some of that information into a cookbook and blog.  Newman studied Land Resources 
                            Planning at Stanford University and received a Master&#39;s Degree in Land Use and Environmental Planning from 
                            UC Berkeley. A popular speaker, the presentation promises to be a sentimental journey.

					<p>A new exhibit, "Riding the Rails" opens on January 10 and runs through April 26 at the Saratoga History Museum.  One of the highlights of the exhibit is a restored Interurban passenger stop.</p>
					<p>
					The interurban was in use from 1903-1933 and provided a transportation solution for enabling travelling between the cities of San Jose, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Campbell, and Palo Alto.</p>
					<p>
					The Interurban was part of a technological breakthrough in the early 1900s across the US.  At that time paved roads were uncommon and automobiles were still a twinkle in Henry Ford's eye. Railroads did not service many of the small towns so the Interurban provided a convenient, economical service. The Peninsular Interurban connected San Jose, Los Gatos, Campbell and Palo Alto using rail and electricity.  The sleek, red cars ran every hour and every 2 hours in the evening.  The clanging of the trolley lured passengers to travel in comfort at 30 mph for dentist appointments in San Jose, to attend school at Stanford University, or go to Congress Springs for recreation. The cost to ride from Saratoga to San Jose was .35 cents or about 3 cents per mile.  Prior to this service residents would travel by horse and buggy which could take up to an hour alone to reach San Jose from Saratoga. In the spring 65-mile long blossom  tours brought people to Santa Clara Valley to enjoy the wonderful scent and see nine million blossoming   trees for just $1.00.  The Interurban could also be used to haul freight such as: oil, fruit, gravel and other cargo.</p>
					<p>
					The exhibit will include many photos and artifacts from that timeframe on the interurban.  The Interurban Stop which provided passenger comfort is believed to be the sole one in Northern California.  The passenger stop was located near Nippon Mura, a popular resort at that time and located on Saratoga-Los Gatos Road.</p>

					The recorded sounds of a blacksmith forge might ring in the hills as the Saratoga Historical Foundation raises funds to convert an <a href="shf_Assets/RenderingBlacksmith.jpg" target="_blank">existing outside area into an interactive blacksmith exhibit</a>. 
					The blacksmith exhibit ties into the nearby 1850's McWilliams House because the owner, James McWilliams was Saratoga's second blacksmith.                    </p>
					<p>The blacksmith exhibit will house tools and items normally worked on by a blacksmith. Some interactivity and possibly sound effects will be available. 
					Also planned is a nonfunctional outhouse as part of the turn of the century theme of all the structures in the Saratoga Historical Park. 
                    All the structures, the McWilliams House, one-room schoolhouse, museum, and soon the blacksmith exhibit are used to teach pioneer living as well as Saratoga's rich history.</p>
					<p>If you would like to contribute to this exhibit ($5000 contribution and higher will be part of a plaque on the outside of the exhibit), please send your contribution to: Blacksmith Exhibit, c/o Saratoga Historical Foundation, PO Box 172, Saratoga, CA 95071. Your donation is tax deductible.</p>
