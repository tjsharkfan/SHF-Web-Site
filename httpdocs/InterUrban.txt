					<p>
					The Saratoga History Museum is pleased to announce a ribbon cutting ceremony for its recently completed restoration of a century old Interurban Stop.  The Interurban Stop is believed to be the only one left in Northern California-- all others have been lost over time.
					<p>
					The Interurban Stop was used by passengers for shelter and located near Nippon Mura Inn along Saratoga-Los Gatos Road.  The Peninsular Interurban rail ran from 1904-1934.  The rail connected San Jose, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Cupertino, and Palo Alto using light rail and was powered by electricity.  The sleek, red cars ran every hour during the day and every two hours in the evening.  Prior to this travel was by horse and buggy.

					Saratoga Mayor Howard Miller and Vice Mayor Mary-Lynne Bernald will assist in the ribbon cutting on March 28 at 1:30 PM at the Saratoga History Museum.  The restoration was possible thanks to a grant by the Farrington Historical Foundation.

					The event is free and the public is invited to see the Interurban Stop as well as the exhibit on the Peninsular Interurban rail. The event will include an original poem written by Bill Peck as well as a brief history of the Interurban by Ray Cosyn.  The family of Historian Willys Peck donated the Interurban Stop to the Saratoga History Museum.   A contest for young children with prizes will also be held. Light refreshments will be available.
