		<p>Japanese-style gardens have enjoyed several periods  of popularity in America, most notably the WWI era and then again in the  1950&rsquo;s. In Santa Clara Valley, three notable gardens appeared in the early part  of the 20th century. All three are located in the West Valley; all  three are located near Highway 9 and are situated within two miles of each  other. The three gardens are known as Nippon Mura, Kotani-En and Hakone.</p>
  		
		<br />
		<h1><a name="nippon"></a>Nippon Mura</h1>
		<p class="dropcap">The  earliest garden was Nippon Mura, located near the rail line of the  Interurban Railway. Of the three, it is the garden that has mostly disappeared,  it&rsquo;s charming structures now nearly buried under layers of additions. Most of  the scenic garden has been paved for a parking lot.</p>
	  	<p>Today the site of Nippon  Mura is known as Hacienda Inn, a restaurant and hotel located on Highway 9  between Los Gatos and Saratoga. But garden sleuths may recognize the  significance of the area by the giant eucalyptuses that still appear in the  parking lot. The oriental style eaves and rooflines of the early building are  also still visible, although finding the shapes among the all the subsequent  additions is a challenge.</p>
	  	<p>Nippon Mura was created  in 1902 by Mr. and Mrs. Theodore J. Morris. They acquired 30 acres on the newly  opened &ldquo;Blossom Trolley Line&rdquo;, the electric railway that ran from downtown San  Jose, through Los Gatos and back down Saratoga Avenue into town. Mr. Morris was  connected with the China Japan Trading Company in Yokohama for thirty years,  and when the couple retired to California, they re-created a Japanese style inn.</p>
	  	<p>At the time Nippon Mura  was opened, the Saratoga area was already well known for its summer homes and  retreats. Nippon Mura offered summer cottages in what is described as a  semi-Oriental style, situated in a garden landscaped with wisteria, iris,  cherry blossoms and chrysanthemums. The Torii tearoom was an important garden  feature. Nippon Mura attracted distinguished guests from both other states and  foreign lands.</p>
		<p>The other two gardens, Hakone and Kotani-En were both created a little later, around 1918. It is frequently noted that the  Panama-Pacific International Exposition, held in San Francisco in 1915 to  celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal, had a tremendous impact on an  appreciation for Asian culture. This show is thought to have influenced the  appearance of these two gardens. Both gardens were created by wealthy San  Francisco families as summer retreats.</p>
  		
		<br />
		<h1><a name="hakone"></a>Hakone</h1>
		<p class="dropcap">Hakone was created for Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Stine. Isabel Stine was quite enchanted by  Japanese culture and fashioned her garden after a mountain resort and lake in  the Fuji-Hakone National Park in southeast Honshu. Mrs. Stine would frequently  dress in a Japanese kimono and dressed her children in Japanese clothing when  they were living at their Saratoga retreat.</p>
	  	<p>Hakone was created on  seventeen acres and includes several buildings. The estate is built into a very  steep hillside. There is a two-acre garden designed by Ihara, reportedly the  court gardener of Japan. A very handsome redwood and bamboo gate marks the  formal entrance to the garden that features two pools and a bridge in the  Shinto tradition. Pebble walks are lined with iris, maples and many varieties  of bamboo. </p>
	  	<p>The Stine family sold  Hakone to Major Charles Lee Tilden in 1932 and the property stayed with various  members of the Tilden family until 1958. Badly neglected and overgrown with  poison oak and other weeds, the garden was then purchased by a consortia of six  concerned families. The six families worked many years to clean out the  invasive plants and to restore and preserve the original features. The families  enjoyed the garden but realized that it needed to be shared with the larger  community. So they sold it to the City of Saratoga as a city park in 1964.  Today Hakone is a local landmark and is owned by the City of Saratoga but  operated by a non-profit board.</p>
  		
		<br />
		<h1><a name="kotani"></a>Kotani-En</h1>
		<p class="dropcap">Kotani-En is a national landmark, placed on the National Register of Historic Places in  1976 by its current owner. The construction of Hakone also commenced about 1918  and took 10 years to finish. The garden was commissioned by San Francisco  industrialist Max M. Cohn in 1918.&nbsp; Mr.  and Mrs. Cohn lived in San Francisco and Mr. Cohn was associated with Crown  Zellerback, the Clorox Company and others. It was reported that he made a  substantial amount of money selling printers ink to clients like the San  Francisco Examiner.</p>
	  	<p>Today Kotani-En is  privately owned and is one of the most interesting and unusual Japanese style  gardens in existence. The garden is situated in a ravine and straddles a  natural creek. The creek has been dammed to create a small pond that is  surrounded by many rare maples, evergreens and other specimens that were  originally imported from Japan. Many of the large boulders that line the side  of the ravine were also selected in Japan and shipped to Saratoga.</p>
	  	<p>The architect was Mr. Takahashi Takashima, an architect that Max Cohn discovered working as a cook in  an Arizona resort. The garden features a pond and waterfalls, a 13th  century style residence, a Buddhist temple, stone lanterns, iron sculptures of  cranes and turtles and Torii gates. Kotani-En was constructed by Japanese  craftsmen using period tools. No nails were used in construction and all  structures were put together with mortise and tenon.</p>
  		<p>The structures are made of cryptomeria cedar  and mahogany with gilded bronze lanterns and a glazed ceramic tile roof. The  interior of the house features traditional construction and furnishings. The  garden temple is dedicated to the deity Ben-ten and the entire garden is  surrounded by a Roji wall that is fifteen feet high in some places. </p>
	  	<p>Kotani-En, the Japanese  garden is apparently part of a much larger design and installation coordinated  by landscape architect Emerson Knight. Max Cohn died December 2, 1935, and his  obituary refers to his development of &ldquo;Little Brook Farm&rdquo; on Bainter Avenue.  The obituary mentions that nearly all of the 20-acre estate was landscaped. It  lists a one-acre Japanese garden as well as other gardens including wild  flowers, cactus, vegetables, a barbeque grounds with hot and cold water, a  dance pavilion, a small outdoor theater, dovecotes, a swimming pool and a  residence. Emerson Knight installed two known plaques with his name. One is  dated 1924 and located on the entrance to the amphitheater.</p>
	  	<p>All of these remarkable  properties could use some additional research since most of the information  currently available comes from secondary sources. The relationship between  Emerson Knight and Takashima needs additional study. Since both Hakone and Kotani-En  employed workers reportedly brought from Japan, and since the Hume apricot  ranch that was adjacent to the Cohn estate also employed Japanese workers, the  relationships should be explored.</p>
