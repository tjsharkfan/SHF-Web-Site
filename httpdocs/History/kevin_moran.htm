		<p class="fonthuge">Kevin Moran</p>

		<br /><br />

		<p>This article appeared in the <em>Saratoga News</em> on April  5, 1995, the 25th Anniversary of Kevin Moran&rsquo;s death. It was written  by his brother, Brian J. Moran in commemoration.</p>
		
		<br />
		<p class="dropcap">Increasingly as a society, we look  toward movie stars and sports legends for inspiration and personal qualities we  would like to emulate, often becoming disappointed.</p>
		<p>Many times  we need not look any further than our own families and loved ones to find those  that will inspire us. I would like to bring to your attention a young man, a  boy really, who demonstrated in his life all the qualities a parent could ever  hope for in their young son. Raised primarily in Saratoga his name was Kevin  Patrick Moran, and he was a hero. His life would only last a precious 22 years.  He has been gone for 25.</p>
		<p>Kevin was  the first-born in a family of 10 children &ndash; four boys and six girls. Holding  that position in the family required of Kevin a lot of responsibility. My  parents expected him to lead the way in all areas of his life and set the  example for his younger brothers and sisters to follow. He did it well and was  a happy child.</p>
		<p>Kevin took  his schoolwork, paper route and other endeavors seriously, for he knew  instinctively that his efforts were a reflection of who he was. I know my  parents love and support for the family made it possible for him to do his  best. He always did.</p>
		<p>He was a thoughtful and generous boy as well. At Christmas,  birthdays and other unexpected times of the year, he demonstrated his  generosity by often purchasing gifts with his hard-earned paper route money. He  was not a saint, but in his heart and actions, I&rsquo;m sure God was pleased. I  remember at times his frustration could get the better of him. At times, I&rsquo;m  sure some of his siblings, myself included, added to that frustration.</p>
		<p>Kevin  graduated from Sacred Heart School in 1962 and Saratoga High School in 1966.  Although he was talented enough to play sports at the high school level, he  decided to focus his time on school and art-time work. He was an excellent  student. He was the type of kid teachers would love to have in their class,  eager to learn while being respectful of his fellow students and teachers.</p>
		<p>In the fall  of 1966, Kevin enrolled at UC-Santa Barbara, majoring in economics. He  continued to work hard, and his grades were proof of this. Kevin was a bright  boy, indeed. However it was his tenacity and hard work that brought him  success. Kevin, who always enjoyed sports, finally decided there was time in  his schedule and made the university&rsquo;s crew team. He enjoyed it immensely.</p>
		<p>The late  1960s and early &lsquo;70s were a difficult time in our nation&rsquo;s history. This was  reflected upon college campuses nationwide. Students and others, upset with the  war in Vietnam, somehow thought that violence against police and businesses,  large and small, was the way to change policy regarding the war. Little did  they realize the casualties they would bring upon the hard working and the  innocent. Kevin was one such casualty. His death left my parents and family  devastated. Our community was saddened.</p>
		<p>It was on  April 18, 1970 when Kevin responded to a campus radio station request by the  student body president for moderate and peaceful students to try and calm the  angry mob that had gathered in Goleta, where the university is located, It was  a request that was honorable but lacked sense. The angry mob rolled police cars  over and proceeded to burn the local Bank of America building. Kevin&rsquo;s heroic  actions brought about his death. While he was attempting to extinguish fires  that had been set inside the bank, a &ldquo;misguided&rdquo; bullet took his life.</p>
		<p>Kevin&rsquo;s  heroic actions were formally recognized through proclamations by various cities  throughout the state, including the city of Saratoga. Then-president Richard  Nixon and then-Gov. Ronald Reagan sent their condolences. Hundreds of citizens  nationwide sent cards and letters expressing their sorrow for our loss. The  city of Saratoga named a newly developed park in honor of his memory.</p>
		<p>Although he  has been gone a quarter of a century, our mom daily passes his picture on the  wall and silently says good morning to her eldest son. On warm summer  afternoons, our dad often takes a bevy of grandchildren for walks through Kevin  Moran Park. While the pain that his death brought has subsided over the years,  my brothers and sisters want him to not be forgotten. He would have turned 47  on March 15.</p>
		<p>I am  happy to report that his parents, brother, sisters, their spouses and his  nieces and nephews are busy with their lives and all is well.</p>
